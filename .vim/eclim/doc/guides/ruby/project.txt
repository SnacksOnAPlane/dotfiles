Creating A Ruby Project
***********************

The goal of this guide is to walk you through creating your first ruby
project via eclim.


Creating a project
==================

The first step is to open a Vim window and create the project by
executing:

>

   :ProjectCreate /path/to/my_project -n ruby

<


The path supplied will be the path to the root of your project.  This
path may or may not exist.  If it does not exist it will be created
for you. When the project is created two files will be added to the
root directory of your project, .project and .buildpath At this time,
the .project file is nothing that you need to worry about maintaining
as it is purely for Eclipse. The .buildpath file on the other hand, is
used to manage your project's dependencies, including dependencies on
other projects and other libraries. For more on maintaining this file
see the build path docs (|vim-ruby-buildpath|).

Note: When creating your first project you may be prompted to supply the
  path to your ruby interpreter.  You must provide the full path to
  your ruby executable before the project will be created.  Tab based
  file completion is supported at the prompt.

Once you've created your project you can use the :ProjectList command
to list the available projects and you should see your newly created
one in the list.

>

   my_project - open   - /path/to/my_project

<


The :ProjectList result is in the form of projectName - (open|closed)
- /project/root/path.  When you create projects, the last path element
will be used for the project name.  If that element contains any
spaces, these will be converted to underscores.

Now that you have a ruby project created, you can now leverage the
various ruby features (|vim-ruby-index|) that eclim provides.
